# Modified Ember-impagination-demo

This is modification of the [demo](http://thefrontside.github.io/ember-impagination) for [ember-impagination](https://github.com/thefrontside/ember-impagination). It produces a great many deprecation warnings. The main change is the component that consumes the dataset. Instead of a scrolling system, two records are displayed and controls are provided to step forward and backward. This implementation is an approximation of a production site.

What follows is the original readme accompanying the demo project.
